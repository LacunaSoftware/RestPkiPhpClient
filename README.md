REST PKI client lib for PHP
===========================
 
This file contains classes that encapsulate the calls to the REST PKI API.

This file depends on the GuzzleHttp package, which in turn requires PHP 5.5 or greater. For a sample using PHP 5.3
or 5.4, see https://github.com/LacunaSoftware/RestPkiSamples/tree/master/PHP
