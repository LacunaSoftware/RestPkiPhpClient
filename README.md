REST PKI client lib for PHP
===========================
**Standard version for PHP 5.5 or greater**

This library contains classes that encapsulate the calls to the REST PKI API.

The recommended way to install **Rest PKI Client lib** is through [Composer](http://getcomposer.org):

    "require": {
        "lacuna/restpki-client" : "^2.9.6"
    }

This library depends on the GuzzleHttp package, which in turn requires PHP 5.5 or greater. If you use PHP 5.3 or
5.4, please see the library [lacuna/restpki-client-legacy](https://github.com/LacunaSoftware/RestPkiPhpClientLegacy).
